    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>As a graduate at Winc Academy I have gained a strong foundation in HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, Redux & Jest, as well as modern front-end frameworks such as React and Vue. I pride
      myself on my creativity and ability to create visually appealing, user-friendly websites
      and applications that are responsive and provide rousing user interactions. </p>
